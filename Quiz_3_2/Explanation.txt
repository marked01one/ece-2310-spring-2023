a. WHY I PICKED THIS PROGRAM:
I liked this program since most other example programs are used to create text content 
only. This program is used to create graphical content, which I feel is pretty unique.


b. BRIEF CODE EXPLANATION:
- When you start the program, a dropdown menu appears.
- Using this dropdown menu, you can generate various different predefined shapes.
- The shape is drawn using either the Pen class (if it's not filled) and the 
SolidBrush class (if it's filled).
- When a certain dropdown menu option is chosen, a switch statement will determine
which shape will be drawn based on the option chosen.
